# Intro to Go

This is an overview of the Go language for people who haven't worked with it yet.

Currently, the presentation is muchly incomplete. In due course I'll fill in the middle with brilliant examples of actual Go code.

This presentation used the [devICT presentation kit](https://github.com/devict/devict-presentation-template) which is itself based on the [reveal.js framework](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js). Thanks Seth and Jacob!
